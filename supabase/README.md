# 🌐 Business Platform with Next.js 15 & Supabase

A comprehensive business website built with **Next.js 15**, **Supabase**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.  
This project demonstrates my expertise in building secure, scalable, and feature-rich applications — leveraging Supabase’s **PostgreSQL**, **RLS policies**, **buckets for media storage**, and **fine-grained access control** to ensure enterprise-grade security.

## 🛡 Supabase Expertise

This project highlights advanced Supabase capabilities:

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** – Ensures users can only access their own data.  
- **Policies** – Fine-grained authorization rules for bookings, products, and user roles.  
- **Buckets (Storage)** – Securely store and serve product images and client assets.  
- **PostgreSQL Tables** – Structured relational schema with foreign keys and constraints.  
- **Auth Integration** – Supabase Auth for secure login & role-based access.  
- **Edge Functions (optional)** – Extend backend logic securely, close to your data.  

By combining Supabase’s managed PostgreSQL with Next.js, this platform is both **scalable** and **secure by design**.
